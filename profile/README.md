# automancy!

*A game about automation, hexagons and magic; and there's no Conveyor Belts.*

You're in a world... a plane, more like, and you're a sort of, Demigod who doesn't have a form. Your goal? Make yourself less lonely. There's seemingly infinite amount of resources just under the plane, but you cannot make sense of their usage and properties... yet.

Research your way through the mystifying colours, and create the stuff of your dreams- gold, energy, lil' hexagonal creatures, and, most importantly- Factories!

Perhaps, you'd be the magnificent "automancer"... if you so choose to call yourself. It's not like anyone else is around, heh?...
