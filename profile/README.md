# automancy!

*automancy!* is a magic-themed, hexagon-based automation game where there is no 'Conveyor Belts'.

---

You're spawned into a weird... plane? There's not a lot to see here other than an endless field of *hexagons*. No sense of directions or how this came to be, but you're not gonna waste time figuring that out.

Instead, your âœ¨ *technological* ðŸ§  \~instincts\~ tell you to study just what you can do with the resources of this world. Which is, *surprisingly*, a lot.

Your ultimate goal? Make yourself less lonely. There's seemingly infinite amount of resources just under the plane, but you cannot make sense of their uses and properties... Not yet!

*Research* your way through the mystical colours and confusing shapes, and create the stuff of your dreams- gold, power, gadgets of magical transformation, lil' hexagonal *buzzy* creatures, and, most importantly- ***factories***!

Perhaps, you'd be the great "automancer"... if you so choose to call yourself. What's *magic*'s worth without some machines to do it for you anyway?

Why is it *hexagon-based*?

Well because hexagons are based, duh.
